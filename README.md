# Medical-Store-Management-System
The medical shop management system was created as an application program to lessen the amount of manual work required to operate medical stores. In order to replace the manual inventory method earlier used by medical retailers the medical shop management system is being introduced. The current medical shop management system's billing is not very effective; the administrator still needs to manually calculate the GST and billing of the medicines, and the system is unable to manage the stock. The need of this project is to make the system more efficient than the existing system, GST will be included in the invoicing, and it will be simpler to calculate the discount. The system will arrange the information related to the medical store's inventory, medications, expenses, sales, and other factors too. Only the store administrator has access to the software because it was mostly built on the administrative side. It also aids in keeping track of all the financial, stock, and sales information and have the various mode of payment.
